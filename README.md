 # Project 3: Real-time Object 2-D Recognition :
 
 This project was an introduction to object detection through a series of computer vision techniques learned in the Class. These techniques included thresholding, morphological operations, connected component labeling, feature extraction, euclidean distance, KNN.

3.Operating system and IDE used to run and compile the code.
Ubuntu 20.04,VS Code


4.The software is organized into a few relevant files with different functionalities.
main_p3.cpp (make a live predictions of live objects)
features.cpp and sam.h (helper files that contain functions to detect objects and calculate features)
training.cpp (build a database of feature vectors for inference later)redict.cpp (make a prediction on a single images)
features.csv (feature vectors for each training example)

5.Instructions for running executables.
make
./Project_3 
(please find the attached Video link)

6.Instructions for running executables.
  uncomment the grassfire transform and connectedcomponentlabel to run these two functions.
